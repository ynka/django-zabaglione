Zabaglione is a work-in-progress project that supports group work.

Work done:
- Support for multiple projects
- Tickets have a customizable status, may belong to the category, are assigned to the person working on them and have priority (tickets with a higher priority are highlighted differently)
- The application implements the backend authentication mechanism (can_view / can_change / can_delete) to individual objects (example: user A can add / edit tickets in the project A, but have read-only access to project B)
- Support for relations between tickets (example 1: task A duplicates task B; example 2: task A precedes task B, etc)
- Easy management of mercurial repository for each project (currently only hg log)
- Full-text search (Haystack) - projects, tickets and news
- Most strings marked for translation
- Migrations supported by South
