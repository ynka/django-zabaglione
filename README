Zabaglione is a work-in-progress project that supports group work.

What was done:

- Users can submit tickets to multiple projects (representing tasks/bugs to fix in project) and assign them a nubmer of parameters (category, status, priority, version).
- The application implements the backend authentication mechanism (can_view / can_change / can_delete) to individual objects (eg, user A can add / edit tickets in the project A, but the project B can only view, without modification, etc.)
- Tickets must be declared in the projects, have a customizable status, may belong to the category, are assigned to the person carrying them and they have a fixed priority (tickets with a higher priority on the list stand out ticket), and finally - relations between tickets (eg A task is a duplicate of the task B, task A must be completed before task B, etc)
- Easy management of mercurial repository for each project (currently only hg log)
- Full-text search (Haystack) among the projects, tickets and news
- Most appropriate strings marked for translation
- Migrations supported by South
